# SeekOut Analytics

Analytics instrumentation, event taxonomy, metric frameworks, and dashboards for **Helix** ([SeekOut.ai](https://seekout.ai)).

This repository is the single source of truth for all product analytics — event definitions, naming conventions, tracking plans, metric models, and dashboard specs. It is designed to be used with **Claude Code** for AI-assisted analytics workflows.

## Quick Start

1. **Understand the product** — Read [`context/product-overview.md`](context/product-overview.md) for personas, surfaces, and product vision.
2. **Learn the schema** — Read [`docs/event-schema.md`](docs/event-schema.md) for naming conventions, standard objects, and PostHog configuration.
3. **Browse existing events** — Read [`docs/event-catalog.md`](docs/event-catalog.md), the master event taxonomy and property dictionary.

## Source of Truth

The 3 canonical analytics documents in `docs/`:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [`event-catalog.md`](docs/event-catalog.md) | Master event taxonomy, property dictionary, implementation status |
| [`event-schema.md`](docs/event-schema.md) | Naming conventions, standard objects, PostHog config, sample code |
| [`dashboards.md`](docs/dashboards.md) | Dashboard specs, funnel definitions, platform health flows |

Supporting metric frameworks:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [`viral-loop-metrics.md`](docs/viral-loop-metrics.md) | 4 viral loops with K-factor decomposition |
| [`network-quantification.md`](docs/network-quantification.md) | Network health metrics (Helix Size, Liquidity, Activation, Bridging) |
| [`tiered-metric-diagrams.md`](docs/tiered-metric-diagrams.md) | 3-tier metric hierarchy with Mermaid diagrams |

## Naming Conventions

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Events | Object-Action, Proper Case, past tense verbs | `Job Created`, `Interest Expressed` |
| Properties | snake_case | `signup_context`, `referrer_user_id` |

Always check `event-schema.md` for standard objects and `event-catalog.md` for existing properties before creating new ones.

## Tracking Plan Workflow

       │

```

## Claude Code Commands

This repo is built for use with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). Available commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/posthog-analytics` | Generate tracking plans and maintain the event catalog |
| `/validate-analytics` | Run the 17-rule cross-document consistency validator |
| `/merge-tracking-plan` | Merge an approved tracking plan into the catalog, then archive it |

## Validation

The validator (`scripts/validate-analytics-docs.py`) enforces 17 consistency rules across all analytics documents — checking event coverage, property compliance, naming conventions, object–action segregation, outcome-terminal form, event-type taxonomy, and funnel definitions. Run history is logged to `logs/conflicts-log.md`.

## Analytics Platform

Events are instrumented via **PostHog**. See [`docs/event-schema.md`](docs/event-schema.md) for PostHog configuration, standard property objects, and implementation code samples.

## Key Rules

- `docs/event-catalog.md` is the **single source of truth** for all events
- Reuse existing events and properties before creating new ones
- Track both **intent and outcome** for critical flows (UI click + server confirmation)
- Viral attribution: sharing chain events must carry `referrer_user_id`
- `acting_as` is required on all hiring surface events
- Tracking plans are **archived after merge** — never deleted
